## CAS (Combat Air Support)
Combat Air Support describes operations integrating with Ground forces.
There are several mission types we can undertake when integrating with ground forces.
In CAS operations, the Flight will be split into three sections.
One of these Sections will be A2A focused, and two will be A2G focused.
Regardless of the mission type, all aircraft should be equiped with at least one weapon capable of engaging air targets.

### Static Deployments
A Static Deployment takes two forms: Persistant Deployment and Air Strike.
These operations share a few characteristics.

Firstly, we will utilize a Rally location.
This will typically be marked with Spades waypoint, and will be one- to two- hexes away from the Area of Operations (AO).
We will use this as a gathering point to strike out from.

A2A fighters will anchor at the Rally point, securing the area in a one-hex radius around the Rally point.
Their focus will be establishing a perimeter and scouting for any incoming forces.

In a standard area-control integration, Ground Strike Fighters are free to roam the AO seeking out and destroying targets at their discretion.
Ground Strike Forces should prioritize ground threats such as skyguards, A2A Sunderers, and Anti-Aircraft guns over other ground targets.
If the Ground Strike Forces need to pull out to repair, they should do so at the Rally point.

If an Air Strike is called, one A2G section will proceed to the target and destroy or supress it.
The second section will refill ammo and standby at the Rally point in reserve.
Should the Attacking section need to re-arm, repair, or lose aircraft, they should make a call, pull out, and regroup at the rally.
The Reserve section will then move in to attack.
This will continue until the target is destroyed or until the airstrike call is lifted.
Rotating sections like this will provide a near-continuous flow of fire on the target.

### Off-Site Air Strike
Occasionally an air strike will be requested in an area other than where the Air squad is currently operating.
In this case, the ENTIRE section should immediately redeploy to the pre-determined Home Plate location (marked with Hearts) and pull aircraft appropriate to their designated role.
The Tactical Lead will indicate Anti-Infantry or Anti-Vehicle loadouts, and mark a Rally point.

The A2A section will pull first, and immediately proceed to the Rally point, engaging any air encountered along the way, and informing the squad of any flak sources en-route.
Upon arrival at the Rally, they should establish an air perimeter, securing the area.

The Attack and Reserve sections will then pull and proceed to the Rally point.
The Attack section will make best speed to the rally point, and should not engage any targets along the way.
Upon arrival at the Rally, they should engage the designated target or area until they need to repair, resupply, or lose aircraft.
They should then make a call, and pull back to the rally point.

The Reserve section will move with the Attack section, but may engage enemy aircraft IF they pose a direct threat to the Attack section.
The Reserve section should engage with the intention of protecting the attack squad; if enemy fighters disengage, they should NOT pursue the enemy fighters.
Upon arrival at the Rally point, the Reserve section will standby to take over the attack if needed.

### Attack Patterns
In all attack patterns
- Do not overfly the Target
- Use Terrain to mask your Egress
- Only one aircraft should be on the Approach Vector at a time.
- DO NOT HOVER. You should be moving at ALL times.

#### Racetrack
Fly in a rough Oval pattern.
Turn into the Attack Vector and dump your magazine
Immediately after dumping your magazine, turn AWAY from the attack vector and reload.
Continue outbound until you see the attack vector is free.

#### Clover
This is a variant of Racetrack, except that your pattern around the target should look roughly like a Clover, attacking from different angles on each pass.
Multiple simultanious attack angles are possible with this approach, and more fighters can operate in the Pattern.

#### L
This is used for single-passes with quick egress under heavy fire.
Make your attack run, then egress to the Rally point

# Sky Squire Certification Path
This certification path is intended to be used by new pilots wanting to get thier foot in the door. It is designed to give the pilot a minimally functional reaver without too much investment.

Adapted from Hader's ESF TOP Gun Guide on Steam [1]

## The Path
It is assumed that you aren't buying any upgrades with DBC. If you do decide to spend some, Rotaries and Hornets are a good buy.

Basics:
- Hover Frame Rank 1
- Fire Supression Rank 1
- Stealth Rank 1
- Mustang Ammo Capacity Rank 2

Optional:
- Hornets/Rocket Pod/Rotary Ammo Capacity Rank 2
- Hornets/Rocket Pod Thermals

If you want to go further:
- Hover Frame Max
- Fire Supression Max
- Stealth Max

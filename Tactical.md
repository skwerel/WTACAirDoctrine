# WTAC Air Tactical Doctrine
Author: NCSkwerel

## Purpose
To provide tactical guidelines for operating in WTAC Air Squads

## Organization
Units in an WTAC Air Squad will be counted in number of Aircraft, regardless of the number of crew/gunners being utilized. Henceforth in this document, an Aircraft will refer to a single craft plus crew.

The smallest tactical maneuvering unit is a Section. A Section consists of 2 or 3 aicraft acting in unision. Each Section will have a Leader and one or more Wingmen. A section will be contained within a Fireteam in-game, giving the leader access to a waypoint. Sections may use Fireteam, Squad, or Discord chat for communication, depending on the size and makeup of the group.

## Flying with a Wingman
The leader picks targets, maneuvers, and formations as appropriate. The Wingmen follow the Leader's lead at all times, and do not break off to chase their own targets. If an Aircraft in a Section goes down, the remaining Aircraft will finish their current engagement, and at the conclusion will respawn as a group or will retreat to a respawn/rally point as designated by the section Leader.

When flying in a Section, a few rules of thumb apply:

- Don't Fly Alone
This means that

- Don't Engage a single Target

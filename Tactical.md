# WTAC Air Tactical Doctrine
Author: NCSkwerel

## Purpose
To provide tactical guidelines for operating in WTAC Air Squads

## Organization
Units in an WTAC Air Squad will be counted in number of Aircraft, regardless of the number of crew/gunners being utilized. Henceforth in this document, an Aircraft will refer to a single craft plus crew.

The smallest tactical maneuvering unit is a Section. A Section consists of 2 or 3 aicraft acting in unision. Each Section will have a Leader and one or more Wingmen. A section will be contained within a Fireteam in-game, giving the leader access to a waypoint. Sections may use Fireteam, Squad, or Discord chat for communication, depending on the size and makeup of the group.

Sections may be combined into a larger unit called a Flight. A Flight will have a leader designated, and will consist of 2 or 3 Sections (4-6 aircraft). Flights will utilize the fireteam waypoints of their respective Sections. Typically, a flight leader will issue orders to an entire Section rather than to an individual Aircraft.

### Designations
The leader of a Section will be designated as "-Lead", for example "Spades-Lead" or "Diamonds Lead".
The Wingmen of a Section will be designated as "-2" and "-3", based on the order in which they appear in the squad listing.

## Flying with a Wingman
The Leader of a section is responsible for picking targets, maneuvers, and formations as appropriate. They are also responsible for enforcing Section cohesion.

The Wingman or a section is responsible for supporting the Leader and informing him of any threats he may not recognize.

Rules of thumb:

- NEVER fly alone

The first implication of this rule is, you should never leave your section to engage or chase a secondary target. If your section is engaged, do NOT chase fleeing targets, unless your entire section is free to do so. Also, as a wingman you should never leave your leader to initiate combat unless ordered to do so.

Also, this means that if any Aircraft in a Section goes down, the remaining Aircraft should finish their current engagement, then retreat to a spawn location designated by the Section leader, join up with their downed craft, and return to the AO.

- Don't gang up on a single target

When engaged in combat, we want to avoid allowing enemies to join the combat without being challenged. No enemy should be allowed to engage without having to worry about being shot. So, when engaging in a 2v2, do not gang up on a single enemy and allow the second enemy to shoot at you uninhibited. Instead, you should each engage a different target. This doesn't mean that you are necessarily fighting a series of 1v1's all the time; the situation may call for target swaps and other forms of maneuvering as appropriate. This same rule applies with larger furballs as well; whenever possible we want to prevent enemies from engaging unchallenged.

The caveat to this rule is, you may gang up on targets IF there are no other targets in the combat; but 'secondary attackers' (those who are not currently engaged by an enemy) should maintain situational awareness, and be ready to break off to engage any new combatants who enter the fight.

## Communications and Terminology

If your Section is in its own squad, use Squad chat for Section communication and Discord for Flight communication. If your Section is in its own fireteam and your Flight is in its own squad (as is often the case when we are in combined arms), use Fireteam chat for your Section and Squad Chat for your Flight. In this case, mute Platoon and use Discord to communicate with the Platoon leader.

Preceed all calls with your designation.

### Terminology

Linked: This call lets your Section or Flight leader know you are in position in a formation. "Hearts-2 Linked"
Visual: Friendly in sight
Blind: No Visual on Friendly
Merge(d): Call indicating a friendly Section has entered visual range.
RTB: Return To Base
Winchester: Out of Ammo
Defensive: Aicraft is in defensive/evasive manuvers in relation to a threat
Engaged: Manuvering with intent to destroy a target. Engaged implies visual/minimap acquisition of target.
Supporting: Assisting an Engaged friendly while maintaing overall battle situational awareness.
Switched: A call for an Engaged and a Supporting friendly to swap roles.
Off (direction): Informative call indicating you are disengaged and manuvering to the indicated direction
Posit: Request for position
Status: A request for an individual aircraft's tactical situation: Offensive, Defensive, or Neutral
Run/Running: Perform a defensive manuver to evade a lock-on missile
Weeds: Indicates you are operating close to the ground; typically means "shut up a minute, i'm trying to not hit rocks"
What State: A request for your ammo status

Splash: You've killed (or visually confirmed a kill) on something. "Splash one liberator".
Bandit: Any enemy aircraft
Bogey: Any unidentified aircraft
Spike: A target has appeared on your minimap, but you don't have visual contact with the target. This is used for momentary blip.
Contact: Full minimap info on a target; target has been q-spotted
Faded: Target has disappeared from minimap; q-spot has worn off
Tally: You have visual contact with a Bandit
No Joy: No visual contact with bandit
Hound Dog: A call typically made by a wingman indicating that he has visual, tally, a clear path to the Bandit, and is in an advantageous position to engage. Used to request clearance to engage a secondary target.
Split: Request to engage a threat; does not require visual contact. Requires flight lead acknowlgement.
Heads Up: Enemy/bogey got through with no kill
Pulling: Indicates that you have a Bandit behind you, "I'm pulling a lib to lead"
Pushing: Indicates you are chasing a Bandit.
Sandwich: Indicates you are between two Bandits
Tumbleweed: Indicates you are no joy, blind, losing situational awarenes, and requesting a directive/orientation

Furball: A thickly-populated dogfight
Home Plate: The designated respawn location. This will either be marked with Platoon waypoint if we are on our own, or Hearts fireteam Waypoint if we are attached toa platoon.
Bullseye: An established reference point, usually a base/hex
Eyeball: In a formation, the aircraft with primary visual search responsibility
Fence: The boundary between friendly and enemy airspace
Gorilla: Large force of indeterminate numbers, composition, and formation
Vic: One target in range, with two others outside range
Line Abreast: Two groups or aircraft side-by-side
Wall: Three or more groups/aircraft side-by-side
Spitter: An aircraft has departed from the engagement

Break: Urgent call indicating an immediate high-performance turn.
Hawk: Staying above a dogfight without engaging. If we outnumber an enemy in a dogfight, one aircraft may be designated to Hawk, that is fly above the dogfight and notify the Flight of any additional incoming bandits.
Rejoin: An order to return to formation
Anchor: To orbit around a fixed point on the ground. A very common maneuver for CAS aircraft.
Continue: Remain in present manuver; do not engage
Bracket: A maneuver in which two aircaft attempt to get on opposite sides of a target
Stinger: A formation with two aircraft in front and one behind
Champaigne: A maneuver in which three aircraft in a Stinger formation engage a target. The forward craft will attempt to bracket while the trailing aircraft attack head-on.
Trail: A formation where a series of aircraft follow each other
Wedge: A formation of two aircraft with one in front and the other displaced laterally behind the leader's wing line
Extend (direction): A temporary disengage to gain distance and altitude on a target with the intent of reentering the fight
Float: An order to laterally expand the formation's spacing to maintain radar contact with a target or to prepare for a defensive response
Knock-it-Off: An order to terminate the intercept/engagement in process
Point: An order to turn towards the Section/Flight leader as a defensive response
Press: An order to continue the attack
Ranch House: An order to return to CAP
Search (direction): Search area indicated and report all contacts
Bugout: Leave the current fight/engagement; indicates will not be reentering the fight.
Separate: Leave the current fight/engagement (usually to mitigate a tactical/positional advantage); indicates fight may be rejoined
Shadow: Follow indicated target

Alpha Check: Request for Range and Bearing to a target
Talk In: Using landmarks to indicate the location of a target. Used if waypoints or smoke are unusable for some reason.


## Section Formations
We will use two different Section formations in WTAC Air: Cruise, and Spread.

### Combat Cruise
Tactical Cruise is a formation used for transit, pursuit, hunting air targets, or escorting friendly transports. Combat Cruise gives the Section flexibility in bearing and distace, and uses varied radius of turn for positioning. Wingmen can be positioned as far forward as 10 Degrees forward of abeam the leader, although 30-45 degrees behind is preferred. Wingmen should also maintain 100 feet of vertical separation, and about 300 feet of horizontal separation (about 1/4 of your minimap when fully zoomed out). This formation doesn't require calls from the leader or specific maneuvers to maintain; Wingmen simply play "follow the leader".

### Combat Spread
Combat Spread  has less flexibility in bearing and greater flexibilty in distance. By it's nature, it requires specific maneuvers to maintain flight integrity. Because it requires maneuvers, it takes a bit more leadership to maintain a group in combat spread. In Combat Spread, the wingman should remain with +/-  10 degrees abeam of the lead, at a distance of 500m - 1km (Keep your lead on the minimap, essentially). The wingman is typically not looking directly at the leader, so maneuvers are utilized to keep relative positioning intact.

NOTE: in CRUISE the WINGMEN are responsible for maintaining positioning; in SPREAD, this is the Leader's responsibility

### Why Combat Spread?
Combat Spread sounds stupidly difficult to maintain. Why in the hell would we use it?

Combat Spread provides a few benefits:

1. Increased separation allows wingmen to focus on spotting external threats at the edge of render distance
2. Increased separation near beam allows for broader field of scan, and prevents wingmen from flying over the same piece of ground that the lead did, decreasing the potential potency of ground-based threats
3. Increased separation allows for more maneuvering flexibility
4. Increased separation prevents multiple aircraft from appearing on the engagement radar of a single threat.

# Sky Knight Certification Path
This certification path is intended to be used by new pilots who intend to dedicate a good deal of time to the air game, perhaps even becoming dedicated career pilots

Adapted from Hader's ESF TOP Gun Guide on Steam [1]

## The Path
It is assumed that you aren't buying any upgrades with DBC. If you do decide to spend some, Rotaries and Hornets are a good buy.

### First 1500 Certs:

- Nosegun (Rotary or Default) Ammo Capacity - Rank 4
- Fire Supression Rank 2 (preferably)
- Stealth Rank 1
- Hover Airframe Rank 3 (For a Scythe, racer is also a good option here)
- Any extra from first 1500 should go to more Nosegun ammo, stealth, or fire supression.

### Next 3000 Certs
- Fire Supression Max
- Nosegun Ammo Capacity - Rank 6
- Nosegun Mag Size - Rank 2

IF YOU HAVE HORNETS OR LOLPODS
- Thermals
- Ammo Capacity Rank 2

### THEN
- Engie Tool Rank 3
- Engie Passive (Aircraft Synergy) Rank 1
- Stealth Max

### Beyond
Your choice. By this point, you should have a handle on your priorities. Finish up your cert paths, or invest in secondary weapons and cert them out.

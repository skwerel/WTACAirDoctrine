# Primary Formations
Formations offer the ability to concentrate firepower, the advantages of mutual support, and improved command and control.

## Organization
The smallest organized unit consists of two aircraft, and is called a SECTION.
A section consists of a Leader and a Wingman.
Next in size is a Division, consisting of 3 or more aircraft.
Adding Sections or Divisions as requried makes large formations.
The Leader is commonly referred to as "Lead", while the Wingman is referred to as "Wing" or "Dash 2" (-2, -3, -4 etc)

## Flight Responsibilities
There are two areas of responsiblity for Leads: Flight Lead and Tactical Lead.
The Flight Lead is responsible for the conduct of the unit as a whole.
He designates operation areas and provides overall guidance to the divsion.
He is the primary contact with outside units, such as other squad or platoon leaders.
He typically holds the Squad Lead position.

Tactical Leads, on the other hand, are more focused on the immediate tactical situation.
They are responsible for designating targets, approving engagements, and keeping track of the Wingman at all times.
They must be considerate of their Wingman by providing a smooth platform for orientation, and by planning ahead to ensure maneuvers are executed cleanly.
They should strive to perform smooth changes in power and altitude.
A lead should avoid using vertical thrusters to suppliment speed in transit, so that the Wingman can adjust positioning as needed.
Tactical Leads also must maintain a high level of situational awareness at all times.

The Wingman's responsibilities are to keep the lead in sight, to maintain proper posiition as directed by the lead, to comply with Lead's orders and give a timely response, to backup the lead with navigation and communication, and to be prepated to assume the Lead position at any time.

Proper Position is defined by three elements:
- Bearing Line (the angle aft of the Lead's wing-line)
- Step-down (verticle offset)
- Lateral Distance

## Relative Motion
Formation Flying is, quite simply, the act of controlling the relative motion between aircraft.
In a Formation, the Lead is considered to be Fixed, and any movement between aircraft is considered movement of the Wingman in relation to the Lead.
Relative motion is the combination of movement about any one, or a combination of all three axes.
Horizontal movement is controlled by using slight pitch and roll movements, combined with vertical thrust.
Verical movement is controlled by veritical thrust, combined with pitch if necessary.
When the Wing is ahead of the bearing line, he is "Acute"; when aft, he is "Sucked".
"Closure" is the relative rate the Wing is approaching the Lead, and "Opening" is the rate at which the Wing is receding the lead.
Always correct for **A**ltitude, **B**earing, then **C**losure/Closeness (the **A**-**B**-**C**'s of formation).

## Cruise Formation
Combat Cruise is a fluid position that can be flown on either side of Lead without directed crossunders, and allows Lead maximum flexibility to maneuver the section as required. 
It is commonly used enroute or in CAS runs.
Cruise provides maneuverability, reduces wingman load, and provides good lookout capabilities.

### Position
The cruise position is defined as a 60 degree cone between Lead's left and right 60 degree bearing lines, with approx 20m step down and 3 to 6 plane widths between aircraft.
Leads should avoid using verticle thrust to increase speed in cruise; Wings may use verticle thrust in combination with pitch to adjust fore/aft position.
During turns, Wing may vary position anywhere within the rear cone, but should strive to remain on the 60 Degree bearing line when possible.
In a turn, Wing can also use Pursuit Curves to maintain separation.
Use Lead Pursuit (pointing his nose ahead of Lead's) to decrease separation, or Lag Pursuit (pointing his nose behind Lead's) to increase separation.
Pursuit curves typically will only need to be held for a few seconds to adjust separation.
A turn TOWARDS the Wing will require the wing to increase separation; turns AWAY from the wing require the wing to decrease separation.

### Lead Change
If a lead change is necessary, the Lead aircraft will initiat the change by increasing lateral separation, then descending and reducing airspeed. The Lead will allow the Wing to pass over, and then ascend into the correct position.

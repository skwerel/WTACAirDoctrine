# WTAC Air Tactical Doctrine
Author: NCSkwerel

## Purpose
To provide tactical guidelines for operating in WTAC Air Squads

## Organization
Units in an WTAC Air Squad will be counted in number of Aircraft, regardless of the number of crew/gunners being utilized. Henceforth in this document, an Aircraft will refer to a single craft plus crew.

The smallest tactical maneuvering unit is a Section. A Section consists of 2 or 3 aicraft acting in unision. Each Section will have a Leader and one or more Wingmen. A section will be contained within a Fireteam in-game, giving the leader access to a waypoint. Sections may use Fireteam, Squad, or Discord chat for communication, depending on the size and makeup of the group.

Sections may be combined into a larger unit called a Flight. A Flight will have a leader designated, and will consist of 2 or 3 Sections (4-6 aircraft). Flights will utilize the fireteam waypoints of their respective Sections. Typically, a flight leader will issue orders to an entire Section rather than to an individual Aircraft.

### Designations
The leader of a Section will be designated as "-Lead", for example "Spades-Lead" or "Diamonds Lead".
The Wingmen of a Section will be designated as "-2" and "-3", based on the order in which they appear in the squad listing.

## Flying with a Wingman
The Leader of a section is responsible for picking targets, maneuvers, and formations as appropriate. They are also responsible for enforcing Section cohesion.

The Wingman or a section is responsible for supporting the Leader and informing him of any threats he may not recognize.

Rules of thumb:

- NEVER fly alone

The first implication of this rule is, you should never leave your section to engage or chase a secondary target. If your section is engaged, do NOT chase fleeing targets, unless your entire section is free to do so. Also, as a wingman you should never leave your leader to initiate combat unless ordered to do so.

Also, this means that if any Aircraft in a Section goes down, the remaining Aircraft should finish their current engagement, then retreat to a spawn location designated by the Section leader, join up with their downed craft, and return to the AO.

- Don't gang up on a single target

When engaged in combat, we want to avoid allowing enemies to join the combat without being challenged. No enemy should be allowed to engage without having to worry about being shot. So, when engaging in a 2v2, do not gang up on a single enemy and allow the second enemy to shoot at you uninhibited. Instead, you should each engage a different target. This doesn't mean that you are necessarily fighting a series of 1v1's all the time; the situation may call for target swaps and other forms of maneuvering as appropriate. This same rule applies with larger furballs as well; whenever possible we want to prevent enemies from engaging unchallenged.

The caveat to this rule is, you may gang up on targets IF there are no other targets in the combat; but 'secondary attackers' (those who are not currently engaged by an enemy) should maintain situational awareness, and be ready to break off to engage any new combatants who enter the fight.

## Communications and Terminology

If your Section is in its own squad, use Squad chat for Section communication and Discord for Flight communication. If your Section is in its own fireteam and your Flight is in its own squad (as is often the case when we are in combined arms), use Fireteam chat for your Section and Squad Chat for your Flight. In this case, mute Platoon and use Discord to communicate with the Platoon leader.

Preceed all calls with your designation.

## Section Formations
We will use two different Section formations in WTAC Air: Cruise, and Spread.

### Combat Cruise
Tactical Cruise is a formation used for transit, pursuit, hunting air targets, or escorting friendly transports. Combat Cruise gives the Section flexibility in bearing and distace, and uses varied radius of turn for positioning. Wingmen can be positioned as far forward as 10 Degrees forward of abeam the leader, although 30-45 degrees behind is preferred. Wingmen should also maintain 100 feet of vertical separation, and about 300 feet of horizontal separation (about 1/4 of your minimap when fully zoomed out). This formation doesn't require calls from the leader or specific maneuvers to maintain; Wingmen simply play "follow the leader".

### Combat Spread
Combat Spread  has less flexibility in bearing and greater flexibilty in distance. By it's nature, it requires specific maneuvers to maintain flight integrity. Because it requires maneuvers, it takes a bit more leadership to maintain a group in combat spread. In Combat Spread, the wingman should remain with +/-  10 degrees abeam of the lead, at a distance of 500m - 1km (Keep your lead on the minimap, essentially). The wingman is typically not looking directly at the leader, so maneuvers are utilized to keep relative positioning intact.

NOTE: in CRUISE the WINGMEN are responsible for maintaining positioning; in SPREAD, this is the Leader's responsibility

### Why Combat Spread?
Combat Spread sounds stupidly difficult to maintain. Why in the hell would we use it?

Combat Spread provides a few benefits:

1. Increased separation allows wingmen to focus on spotting external threats at the edge of render distance
2. Increased separation near beam allows for broader field of scan, and prevents wingmen from flying over the same piece of ground that the lead did, decreasing the potential potency of ground-based threats
3. Increased separation allows for more maneuvering flexibility
4. Increased separation prevents multiple aircraft from appearing on the engagement radar of a single threat.

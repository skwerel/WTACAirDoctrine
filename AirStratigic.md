# Air Wing Stratigic Doctrine

Author: Skwerel
Western Tactical

## Introduction

This document outlines the purpose and organization of Western Tactical's air wing, as well as defines the basic mission types we will typically encounter. This document does not go in-depth into the tactics used to accomplish missions or objectives; that information will be included in a companion document. All questions may be directed to the current wing commander of WTAC Air.

## Purpose

The purpose of WTAC Air Wing is:
 * To provide a venue for pilots to fly together on a regular basis
 * To connect pilots, encouraging mutual learning experiences and mentor-based training
 * To provide air support for various WTAC operations

## Logistics

### Ops

Air Wing Ops will be held twice a week on Friday and Sunday evenings. Additional ops may be occasionally held as leadership availability permits. These operations will take place from 7:30-10:30PM Server Time (PST/PDT). Depending on leader availability, other operations may be held at other times; monitor @FlightAlert in the WTAC Discord to be notified of these operations.

During operations, when alerts are active we will focus on objective-based play, assisting with the alert as we deem appropriate. When no alert is active, we will focus on training and improvement, either practicing maneuvers or pairing off and dueling.

### Organzation

During operational play, air crews will be divided up into groups called Sections. A Section will be comprised of 2-3 aircraft (including gunners), depending on operational needs and group size. Ideally, Air-to-Air (A2A) oriented Sections will have 2 aircraft, while Air-to-Ground (A2G) oriented Sections will have 3, although this may change as needed. Sections will be contained in a fireteam in-game, and assigned by the Squadron Leader. Typically, each aircraft in a Section will carry a similar loadout, as they will work in tandem to accomplish tasks. Each Section will have a Lead aircraft, and 1 or 2 Wingmen. The Lead aircraft will determine Section travel speed and patrol routes, and will select targets for the Section.

Two or more Sections will frequently be combined together into a larger group called a Flight. A Flight will contain 4-6 total aircraft. Each Flight will have a Leader, who will serve the same role as a Leader in a Section. The Flight Leader will also coordinate the two sections in various Tactial manuvers, some of which are described in the forthcoming Air Wing Tactical Manual. Additionally, more information about the roles of Leaders and Wingmen will be described in the same Manual.

### Communications

During operations, if another WTAC squad is online, we may be working with a larger platoon or group. In these instances, we will utilize fireteam chat for communications between members of a section, and squad chat for communication with the entire wing. We will use either discord or platoon chat to communicate with the larger platoon.

If we are not working in coordination with a platoon, we will use squads for each section, to best visualize who is in what section. In these instances, Squad chat may be used for inter-section communications.

The #air-chat channel in discord will be used for all offline communications, including coordinating ops times and schedules, as well as organizing duels, mentorships, and other training scenarios.

Section and Flight leads should utilize Fireteam Waypoints to communicate objectives or any other neccessary waypoint. Squad Waypoints will be utilized for communicating with other squad or platoon leads when coordinating with a platoon.

## Mission Types

During operational flight, the various activities undertaken by WTAC Air Sections can be broken down into several mission types. A flight's component Sections may often be simultainously taking on different Missions.

### Close Air Support (CAS)

These missions are typically undertaken by A2G Aircraft.

#### Scouting

This mission is most frequently used when coordinating with Armor. Sections will be tasked with identifying enemy armor positions and communicating them with the armor lead. Secondarily, the Section will aid their attached armor group in eliminating both air and armor threats. A Section may be embedded with an Armor squad for this purpose. Scouting requires good situational awareness, as well as communication skills. It is highly recommended for scouting Sections to have mics. When fulfilling a Scouting role, inform the requesing commander of any incoming bogeys within 1.5 hexes of the AO.

#### Surgical Strike

At times, squads we are supporting might request that a particular target be taken out, typically a sunderer or a tank in a dug-in position. Hornets are ideal for this mission.

#### Supression

A section may be asked to provide supressive fire on a lane, door, or other location. In this case, the purpose is to distract and disorient the enemy, preventing them from moving. Rocket Pods are especially potent at this role.

Typically, platoon or squad leaders will use either colored smoke or squad waypoints to mark targets for Surgical Strike or Supression missions. If a target is being designated by a Section lead, they should use fireteam waypoints to mark the target (if able).

### Combat Air Patrol (CAP)

CAP Missions primarily consist of A2A combat.

#### Escort

Sometimes Air will be asked to escort an asset, usually a drop vehicle, through or near enemy territory. In this instance, air escorts provide a few benefits to the escortee. Firstly, escorts can attack any enemy air attempting to take down the drop vehicle. Secondarily, escorts can saturate an area with targets, diffusing the amount of flak than can focus on a single drop vehicle. Care must be taken when escorting a vehicle to keep close enough to discourage enemies from focusing down the escorted vehicle, but far enough to allow the escortee to perform evasive manuvers as needed.

#### Air Superiority

The purpose of this mission is to secure airspace around an Objective or Bullseye. This allows CAS teams to operate unhindered by enemy air. This mission is also used to drive out enemy aircraft from harassing a friendly unit, or to spot and eliminate incoming drop vehicles.  Air Superiority missions usually involve operating near enemy bases; care must be taken to avoid flak.

#### Back-Line Security

Back-Line Security is an operation wherein enemies are hunted down and destroyed deep within friendly territory. Often these enemies are either looking for easy, unaware targets leaving the warp gate, or ambitious sky-knights looking for a fun fight. Care must be taken when engaging these targets, as they often are skilled at dogfighting, and can pose a challenge to newer pilots.
